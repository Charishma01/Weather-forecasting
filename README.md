# Weather-forecasting using LSTM Model
This project demonstrates how to use LSTM models for predicting weather conditions, specifically temperature and pressure. The models include:

## Introduction
This repository contains code for building and training LSTM models for weather forecasting. 
It includes:
- Univariate LSTM: Predicts temperature using past temperature data.
- Multivariate LSTM: Uses multiple weather features for forecasting.
- Multi-Step LSTM: Forecasts temperature and pressure for multiple future time steps.
