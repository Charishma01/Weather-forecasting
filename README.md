# Weather-forecasting using LSTM Model
This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for predicting weather conditions, specifically temperature and pressure. The models include various architectures designed for univariate, multivariate, and multi-step forecasting.


## Introduction
This repository contains code for building and training LSTM models for weather forecasting. 
It includes:
- Univariate LSTM: Predicts temperature using past temperature data.
- Multivariate LSTM: Uses multiple weather features for forecasting.
- Multi-Step LSTM: Forecasts temperature and pressure for multiple future time steps.

## Features
- Forecasts temperature and pressure.
- Handles single-step and multi-step predictions.
- Supports both univariate and multivariate time series.
- Visualizes actual vs predicted values.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Approach
Univariate LSTM Models:
- Predicts a single variable (e.g., temperature) using past data.
- Implements Vanilla, Stacked, Bidirectional, CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM architectures.
Multivariate LSTM Model:
- Uses multiple input features (e.g., temperature, humidity) for enhanced predictions.
Multi-Step LSTM Model:
-Forecasts multiple future time steps for temperature and pressure.
-Includes Vector Output and Encoder-Decoder architectures.
