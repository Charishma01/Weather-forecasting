# Weather-forecasting using LSTM Model
This project demonstrates how to use LSTM models for predicting weather conditions, specifically temperature and pressure. The models include:

Univariate LSTM: Predicts future temperature using past temperature data.
Multivariate LSTM: Uses multiple weather variables to predict temperature and pressure.
Multi-Step LSTM: Forecasts temperature and pressure for several future time steps.
